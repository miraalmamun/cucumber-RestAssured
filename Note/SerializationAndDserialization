Serialization and Deserialization of Request/Responses with POJO(Plan object java object) classes.

Serialization: In Rest Assured context is a process of converting a Java object into Request
body(Payload).

Rest Assured also Supports deserialization by converting Response body back to Java object.
When you get response back from your rest assured test, we can convert response Json/XML into
java object(with help of POJO)

Advantages: Easy to parse and extract response(Json/XML) values if they are wrapped as Java
object.

User friendly Metods can be created which makes code more readable.


Design Approach:
Java object is constructed with the support of POJO classes.

POJO classes are created based on the Request/Response payload.

What Additional Libraries required?

For JSON you need to have either Jackson, Jackson2. Gson or Johnzon in the classpath
For XML you need JAXB.
