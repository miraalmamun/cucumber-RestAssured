How to avoid “StaleElementReferenceException” in Selenium?
How To Handle Stale Element Exception in Selenium(With Code)?

Solution 1: Refreshing the web page

You could refresh the page and try again for the same element.

Assume you are trying to click on a link and getting the stale element exception.

Sample code to overcome the issue

driver.navigate().refersh();
driver.findElement(By.xpath("xpath here")).click();

Solution 2: Using Try Catch Block
If an element is not attached to DOM then you could try using ‘try-catch block’ within ‘for loop’

// Using for loop, it tries for 3 times. 
// If the element is located for the first time then it breaks from the for loop nad comeout of the loop
for(int i=0; i<=2;i++){
  try{
     driver.findElement(By.xpath("xpath here")).click();
     break;
  }
  catch(Exception e){
     Sysout(e.getMessage());
  }
}

Solution 3: Using ExpectedConditions.refreshed
Wait for the element till it gets available

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(By.id("table")));

Use ExpectedConditions.refreshed to avoid StaleElementReferenceException 
and retrieve the element again. This method updates the element by redrawing 
it and we can access the referenced element.

wait.until(ExpectedConditions.refreshed(ExpectedConditions.stalenessOf("table")));

Solution 4: Using POM
We can handle Stale Element Reference Exception by using POM.
